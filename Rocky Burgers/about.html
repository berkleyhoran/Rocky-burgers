				<p class="maintext">Best Quality Burgers in town. Off the charts. 
					Step into any ROCKEY BURGERS, and you'll notice we're different. 
					From our famous (free) house-made pickles, to the hand-painted signage, to our cheerful staff, 
					we build our restaurants like we build our burgersâ€“sustainably, 
					locally, and with an unwavering commitment to quality. Fresh, quality produce, 
					meat, dairy and buns, sourced from partners located just miles from our restaurants, 
					are the ingredients to making the perfect burger. 
					This commitment to creating the best possible food for our guests is a direct reflection of our 
					promise of creating fast food burgers using slow food values. Bite into any Super burger, 
					and taste the difference. Our burgers, fries, and shakes are made with the finest, 
					freshestingredients available.All our beef is Rockey Farms, humanely-raised, vegetarian-fed, 
					ground fresh daily, and sourced from a family-owned ranch. All of ourshakes and cones are made with 
					organic cream from Rockey Creamery, a small, family-owned, organicfarmlocated South of Nephi, 
					Utah. Our bunsare baked to our specification by an artisan baker in Nephi, UT. The potatoes we use to 
					make our French fries are made from potatoes grown in North America by growers who are required to 
					identify the genetic source of their seed potatoes. We do not work with genetically modified potato 
					varieties. Our potatoes are processed fresh off the field and delivered to us 
					without any modifications. We proudly serve Sir Kensington ketchup.</p>
